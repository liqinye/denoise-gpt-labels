0,Financial conditions continue to pose a downside risk to the outlook for growth.,0
2,"Balance Sheet Policies and Reserve Demand Taking stock, I note that one approach to the constraints on policy imposed by the current low level of interest rates is to make what were previously unconventional toolsâ€”balance sheet policies and forward guidanceâ€”as conventional as possible.",2
0,"Well, you know, if the economy were disappointing, we—you know, our actions wouldn’t purely be based on inflation, we would also take employment into account.",0
2,"Inflation compensation for 2007 declined modestly, perhaps reflecting the further drop in spot energy prices, but was largely unchanged at longer maturities.",2

0,"Moreover, we should recognize that these disinflationary effects could dissipate or even be reversed in coming years.",0
1,"So you’re going to have different perspectives from Committee participants about how fast growth will be, how fast the labor market will heal, or how fast—sorry, inflation will move up.",2
1,"However, some participants noted that the recent rise in the prices of oil and other commodities, as well as increases in import prices stemming from the decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, could boost inflation pressures.",1
2,"Several participants observed that the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas had stayed near 2 percent recently, underscoring the view that the recent low readings on inflation will prove transitory.",2
2,"Although many participants remained concerned about downside risks attending the outlook for inflation, a majority of participants saw the risks to the outlook for inflation as balanced.",2
2,The Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.,2
2,"The forecast for headline inflation was in the same range as that for core inflation in 2008 and 2009, reflecting expectations that energy prices would level off and then turn down and that increases in food prices would slow to a pace more in line with core inflation.",2

1,"But if the economy instead began to overheat, threatening to push inflation to an undesirably high level, the FOMC would have ample scope to respond through tighter monetary policy.",1
1,"This term has been interpreted by many observers to mean that the Committee's reaction function aimed to be symmetric on either side of the 2 percent inflation goal, and that the FOMC set policy with the (ex ante) aim that the 2 percent goal should represent an inflation ceiling in economic expansions following economic downturns in which inflation falls below target.",2
0,The deceleration seemed to reflect primarily an unwinding of heightened demand for the relative safety and liquidity of money market mutual funds that had boosted M2 in prior months.,2

2,The members also agreed on the desirability of retaining the assessment that the risks with regard to the outlook for economic growth were balanced.,2
2,That means that we can run at low levels of unemployment and have a historically good—in some dimensions—labor market without having to worry about inflation.,0
0,"The upswing in M2 growth since late winter stemmed in part from the temporary effects of mortgage refinancing, which boosted liquid deposits over this period, though M2 was also buoyed by strong gains in nominal income.",2

2,"Projections of the rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, had a central tendency of 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 percent, on the high side of the outcome for 1997 when the rise in the index was held down by damped increases in food prices and declines in energy prices.",1
1,"the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâ€”and the challengeâ€”of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate.5 To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it will conduct policy to achieve inflation outcomes that keep long-run inflation expectations anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.",2
0,There appears to have been some evolution in inflation-targeting regimes toward greater flexibility.,2

1,"However, with tightening resource constraints indicating unsustainable growth, only tentative signs that growth might be slowing, and various factors that had been damping prices now turning around, all the members agreed on the need for a slight tightening at this meeting to raise the odds on containing inflation and forestalling the inflationary imbalances that would undercut the very favorable performance of the economy.",1
1,"Although readings on core inflation had improved modestly since the spring, nearly all participants viewed core inflation as uncomfortably high and stressed the importance of further moderation.",1
1,"With respect to the new framework itself, the statement now notes that the neutral level of the federal funds rate has declined relative to its historical average and therefore that the policy rate is more likely than in the past to be constrained by its ELB, and, moreover, that this binding ELB constraint is likely to impart downside risks to inflation and employment that the Committee needs to consider in implementing its monetary policy strategy.",0
0,"I would note, by the way, that at the current moment, it doesn’t really matter whether we have one mandate or two, because we’re below our inflation target and we—unemployment is above where we’d like it to be.",0
1,"On the upside, recent fiscal policy changes could lead to a greater expansion in economic activity over the next few years than the staff projected.",1
2,"Additionally, can one make any other generalizations concerning recessions that follow asset-price booms and busts and how they differ from other recessions?",2

0,"On balance, core consumer price inflation was projected to remain subdued and quite possibly edge lower.",0
1,"The real federal funds rate probably was not greatly out of line with its appropriate level, and the rise in longer-term interest rates and the exchange rate meant that financial conditions were now exerting more restraint than earlier this year.",1
2,Some participants noted that communications about the appropriate path of policy would be a focus of market participants in the current environment and commented that it would be important to emphasize that the Committee's reaction function or commitment to its monetary policy framework had not changed.,2
2,"Participants' assessments of the economic outlook were little changed, with the intermeeting information generally seen as suggesting that economic growth would remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up gradually.",2
1,Estimates by the staff of the Federal Reserve indicate that about 40 percent of the growth in outstanding home mortgage debt during the past five years originated as financing the extraction of home equity.,2

0,"Now, with inflation below 2 percent, I think it’s appropriate that the labor market be that tight.",0
2,"The staff expected the 12-month change in PCE prices to gradually move down in coming months, reflecting, importantly, the fading of base effects along with smaller expected monthly price increases,",0
0,"The risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting the staff's assessment that neither monetary nor fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy withstand substantial adverse shocks; the downside risks to the forecast of economic activity were seen as more pronounced than in December, mainly reflecting the greater uncertainty about global economic prospects and the financial market turbulence in the United States and abroad.",0

1,"Our role, though, is also to, you know, to make sure that—that maximum employment happens in a context of price stability and financial stability, which is why we’re gradually raising rates.",1
2,"In terms of missing on inflation, policymakers' projections looked very much like most of the public's.",2
0,"Since the previous FOMC meeting, spreads on municipal bonds narrowed substantially, on net, moving near levels observed for several years before the pandemic, as investor demand exhibited some recovery over much of the period from earlier weak levels.",2
2,President George dissented because she believed that an unchanged setting of policy was appropriate based on the incoming data and the outlook for economic activity over the medium term.,1
1,Such a jump could raise core inflation temporarily if it is passed through to other prices or if it contributes to increasing inflation expectations.,1

2,"With longer-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, changes in commodity and import prices expected to be modest, and significant resource slack persisting over the forecast period, inflation was forecast to be subdued through 2015.",0
1,"Following the deepest plunge since the Great Depression, employment and activity rebounded faster and more sharply than anticipated.",2
1,"With regard to the nation as a whole, members noted that rising levels of employment and incomes were continuing to foster solid growth in consumer spending, a development that was abetted by the sharp increases that had occurred in household wealth as a consequence of the extended uptrend in stock market prices and to a lesser extent the appreciation of home prices.",2
2,"Fiscal policy was expected to be somewhat less expansionary next year, though still an important contributor to economic growth.",2
0,"In the United Kingdom, however, gilt yields declined and the pound weakened against the dollar in response to weaker-than-expected inflation data and to an upward revision by the Bank of England, at its early February policy meeting, of its assessment of the degree of slack in the labor market.",0
2,We're looking at wages and we're looking at ultimately inflation.,2
1,Readings on consumer price inflation had picked up somewhat mainly because of increases in oil and gasoline prices earlier in the year.,2
2,"Through this channel, the decline in inflation volatility should be reflected in a smaller inflation risk premium in nominal bond yields, which is exactly what is estimated in the Kim, Walsh, and Wei (2019) yield curve model (figure 4, ""Term Premium Decomposition"").",2
1,"So that’s the kind of thinking we’ll be doing, and, again, we’re looking—ultimately, we’re not going to declare victory until we see a series of these, really see convincing evidence, compelling evidence, that inflation is coming down.",0
2,Here's a wonderful game: Assume that the ECB governing council or the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee replaced the Federal Open Market Committee and made monetary policy in the United States--or vice versa.,2
2,The simplest answer is that interest rates should vary to imitate qualitatively the way they would behave if the Fed were implementing a money supply target.,2
1,But what if the Fed were actually to propose a soft form of inflation targeting?,0
0,"Although members generally saw little risk that maintaining very low short-term interest rates could raise inflation expectations or create instability in asset markets, they noted that it was important to remain alert to these risks.",2
2,"This conclusion is buttressed by recent sizable increases estimated for labor productivity for the manufacturing sector, derived from a data system that, for the most part, is independent of the national accounts.",2
2,But this is largely accounted for by a convergence of inflation rates.,2
1,"In the Committee's discussion of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, members agreed that the retention of an asymmetric directive toward tightening was consistent with their view that the risks remained biased toward higher inflation.",1
2,"Changes in the deficit resulting from changes in economic conditions, health prices, demographics, and other technical or economic factors were allowed to show through to the deficit without sanction.",2

1,Some price increases had been noted,2
0,The external sector was expected to exert a small restraining influence on economic activity over the projection period.,0

2,Prospects for ProductivityLet me close with some comments on the outlook for productivity.,2
1,"The first round of the three-month U. S. dollar auctions that major foreign central banks announced on September 15 was held in October; demand was quite limited, and only the European Central Bank (ECB) drew on its swap line with the Federal Reserve.",2
2,Setting the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances 15 basis points below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate was intended to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates well within the FOMC's target range.,2
2,We might look to the historical experience with oil price shocks in the 1970sâ€”not a happy story.,2
0,"Yields on nominal Treasury coupon securities declined over the intermeeting period while yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities were roughly unchanged, which left inflation compensation noticeably lower.",0
1,"Our mandate, sorry, is price inflation.",2
2,"Conclusion To sum up, none of us, obviously, can see the future, and instead we shall have to monitor incoming data closely for evidence of any shifts in recent productivity trends.",2
1,"The Committee also noted that output had continued to expand at a solid pace, new hiring had appeared to pick up, and although incoming data on inflation showed that it had moved somewhat higher, longer-term inflation expectations had remained well contained.",2
1,Long-run price stability certainly is essential for achieving maximum employment.,2
2,But monetary policy has little ability to affect inflation this year.,2
1,"Putting It All Together I would now like to step back and consider the relative contributions to the trade deficit of each of the explanations I have discussed, as shown in figure 6.7 To the extent that the contributions of these shocks are reasonably well measured by the macroeconomic model simulations, the most important message I draw from them is that no single factor constitutes a dominant explanation of the deterioration in the U.S. current account balance.",2
2,"Even so, most members viewed a slowing to a rate closer to most estimates of the growth of the economy's potential as a reasonable expectation.",2
2,"However, the fact that most other industrial countries did not experience the same increase in productivity growth as the United States during that period, even as they became more open to trade, suggests that the relationship between productivity and trade may be complex.",2
0,"First, the significant appreciation of the dollar over the last two years has clearly had an important restraining effect on U.S. inflation, both via the direct effect on the prices of imported goods and on the pricing power of domestic firms producing import-competing goods.",0
1,The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate from the Congress to pursue policies that aim to achieve and sustain maximum employment and price stability.,2
0,"However, other participants noted that the continued subdued trend in wages was evidence of an absence of upward pressure on inflation from the current level of resource utilization.",0
1,"The July-August deficit in U. S. trade in goods and services was higher than its average in the second quarter, as further growth in imports exceeded the rise in exports.",2
0,"Indeed, most anticipated that inflation will slow for a time to rates somewhat lower than those they judge consistent with the dual goals of price stability and maximum employment, initially reflecting the recent declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and later responding to several years of substantial economic slack.",0
2,"The members viewed the outlook for core price inflation as still quite benign, largely reflecting the ample availability of labor and other producer resources to accommodate rising economic activity and the favorable prospects for further robust growth in productivity.",0
1,Many indicated that they expected cyclical pressures associated with a tightening labor market to show through to higher inflation over the medium term.,1
0,"Residential construction activity remained at a high level, evidently supported in part by recent declines in mortgage interest rates.",0

2,What implications do these results have for our broader understanding and for the practice of monetary policy?,2
2,"As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy.",2
1,"Although the aggregate balance sheet for the household sector was strong and the unemployment rate was low, consumer sentiment had deteriorated, and households were reportedly becoming more cautious in their expenditure decisions in light of uncertainty about the economic outlook and the reduction in purchasing power induced by price rises, particularly increases in the prices of essentials such as food, housing, and transportation.",0
0,"I mean certain parts of South Carolina have developed pretty strongly but the part where I come from—mostly agricultural, it has a little bit of manufacturing—has a very high unemployment rate, a high foreclosure rate, and people are having a hard time there.",0
2,"While these studies allow for differences in the weighting of price indexes across different income groups, they rely on the same elementary price indexes for subcategories of goods and services.",2
1,"Continued gains in employment and income, high household net worth, and low gasoline prices were viewed as factors that should support consumer spending in coming months.",2
0,"Those few members who expressed a preference for easing at this meeting believed that, with unit labor costs and inflation expectations contained, enough evidence of further weakness already existed to warrant an immediate action.",0
0,"During the five years before the crisis, core goods made a small negative contribution to inflation.",2
2,"In dissenting, Mr. Meyer noted that although the money growth ranges do not play an important role in the conduct of monetary policy today, Congress has mandated that the FOMC set and report ranges for money and credit growth.",2
2,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999.",2
0,"Moreover, the staff still judged that the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were tilted to the downside, with a corresponding skew to the upside for the unemployment rate.",0
1,"While a preemptive tightening move might be warranted in the not-too-distant future to help contain inflationary pressures in the economy, these members believed that a symmetrical directive would best convey the message that no tightening action was contemplated for the weeks immediately ahead.",1
0,Domestic demand growth has slumped in many foreign economies because of varying combinations of an increase in saving rates and a decline in investment.,2
1,"Core price inflation was projected to rise a little over the forecast horizon, in part as a result of higher import prices",1
2,"Some participants stated that low interest rates appeared to be contributing to strong sales of autos or, more generally, of consumer durables.",0
2,"Net exports subtracted more than 1/2 percentage point from GDP growth in both 2014 and 2015,",2
2,"From a policy perspective, a difficulty with all these measures is that they reflect expectations of headline inflation rather than the core inflation measures usually emphasized in the monetary policy context.",2
2,"Housing demand remained strong, but business fixed investment was still in the doldrums and consumer spending had flagged in late summer before apparently picking up somewhat in the autumn.",2
2,"Overall employment gains were relatively well maintained, and labor markets were still tight though showing signs of softening.",2
2,"In such an environment, a central bank mandated to pursue price stability can be flexible according to the circumstances, while one with a numerical target may need to obtain formal modification of its objectives.",2
2,"Countries differ in this regard, both in formal mandate and in actual practice.12 As an extensive academic literature shows, however, the general approach of inflation targeting is fully consistent with any set of relative social weights on inflation and unemployment",2
0,"And, and those are—that’s again—that goes to keeping this episode as short as it can be and avoiding unnecessary business bankruptcies, unnecessary household bankruptcies, and unnecessary long-term stays of unemployment or supporting people through them so that they can maintain their financial footing and their lives and be able to go back to work in a productive way.",0
0,"That said, the data also indicate that a surge in COVID-19 cases in the summer and supply-chain bottlenecks held back economic activity in the third quarter.",0
0,"Of course, the cost of this critical stabilization was the high unemployment and lost output associated with the sharp 1981-82 recession.",0
1,The first question is whether the degree of easing implemented in response to financial market turbulence and the abrupt downward revision in the forecast should be reassessed in light of the subsequent improvement in financial conditions and the continued robustness of domestic demand.,0
0,"In general, financial markets were viewed as well positioned to support more vigorous expansion in economic activity.",0
2,"After falling steeply before the August FOMC meeting, emerging market equity prices were little changed, on net, over the period.",2

2,Members agreed that they would continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.,2
0,"However, at 7.7 percent, the unemployment rate remains elevated.",0
2,"However, in the past two decades, what constitutes money has been obscured by the introduction of technologies that have facilitated the proliferation of financial products and have altered the empirical relationship between economic activity and what we define as money, and in doing so has inhibited the keying of monetary policy to the control of the measured money stock.1 Another example of ongoing structural change relates to innovations in mortgage finance.",2

1,"After precipitous drops in March and April, employment rose strongly in May and June as many people returned to work from temporary layoffs.",2
0,"Recently, however, incoming information has suggested that the baseline outlook for real activity in 2008 has worsened and the downside risks to growth have become more pronounced.",0
0,"Those factors included the increasing spread of the coronavirus in the United States since mid-June; the reactions of many states and localities in slowing or scaling back the reopening of their economies, especially for businesses, such as restaurants and bars, providing services that entail personal interactions; and some high-frequency indicators that pointed to a deceleration in economic activity.",0
2,"Inflation, in fact, is under control, and starting to come down.",0
1,"And that is a statement about productivity growth, which has been pretty disappointing.",2
0,"Many members concluded that because there did not seem to be any urgency to tighten current policy for domestic reasons, given the likelihood that inflation would remain subdued for a while, important weight should be given to potential reactions abroad.",0
2,"Fortunately, as we make monetary policy we have the advantage of several forecasts.",2
1,"Members who preferred to retain an asymmetrical directive agreed that, although there was little likelihood of a further policy change during the intermeeting period, such a directive was the best way to convey their concerns about the risks of rising inflation and the potential need for policy tightening over time.",1

2,"Following the GFC, it took more than eight years for employment and inflation to return to similar mandate-consistent levels.",2
2,"On balance, however, the members generally believed that prospective trends in overall economic activity and the persistence of strong competitive pressures in most markets, including the effects of foreign competition, were likely in the context of now firmly embedded expectations of low inflation to moderate any tendency for price inflation to accelerate over the year ahead.",0

2,"Indeed, CPI inflation does appear to have become more sensitive to import prices over time, both in the United States and in other OECD countries (Pain, Koske, and Sollie, 2006).3 Can domestic monetary policy still control domestic interest rates and so stabilize both inflation and output?",2
2,"Because good forecasts are so crucial to good monetary policy, I hope and expect to see a great deal more work exploring the robustness of alternative forecasting methods.",2

1,"in particular, the Fed's loss of credibility significantly increased the cost of achieving disinflation.",0

1,And—but inflation expectations did not move strongly down here in the United States.,2
2,The downside risks from the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down or that the dollar could appreciate substantially were seen as roughly counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer-run potential.,2
0,"Overall inflation was projected to remain subdued, with the staff's forecasts for headline and core inflation little changed from the previous projection.",0
2,"Beyond 2017, the forecast for real GDP growth was little revised.",2
0,"Because inflation expectations are now more firmly tied down, surges and declines in energy prices do not significantly affect core inflation and thus do not force a policy response to inflation to the extent they did three decades ago.",2
0,"The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce the slack in labor and product markets over the projection period, and progress in reducing the unemployment rate was expected to be gradual.",2

2,The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.,2
1,All members agreed that the statement to be released after the meeting should convey that inflation risks remained dominant and that consequently keeping policy unchanged at this meeting did not necessarily mark the end of the tightening cycle.,1
2,"So, I think you raise a very important point because, although there is a great deal of market focus on the timing of liftoff, what to matter in thinking about the stance of policy is what the entire path of interest rates will look like.",2

1,"As U.S. business investment has recently begun a cyclical recovery while residential investment has remained strong, the domestic saving shortfall has continued to widen, implying a rise in the current account deficit and increasing dependence of the United States on capital inflows.9 According to the story I have sketched thus far, events outside U.S. borders--such as the financial crises that induced emerging-market countries to switch from being international borrowers to international lenders--have played an important role in the evolution of the U.S. current account deficit, with transmission occurring primarily through endogenous changes in equity values, house prices, real interest rates, and the exchange value of the dollar.",2

1,"The staff forecast for total PCE price inflation in 2018 was revised up slightly, mainly because of a faster-than-expected increase in consumer energy prices in the second half.",1
0,"For these reasons, I have been interested in exploring approaches that expand the space for targeting interest rates in a more continuous fashion as an extension of our conventional policy space and in a way that reinforces forward guidance on the policy rate.18 In particular, there may be advantages to an approach that caps interest rates on Treasury securities at the short-to-medium range of the maturity spectrumâ€”yield curve capsâ€”in tandem with forward guidance that conditions liftoff from the ELB on employment and inflation outcomes.",0

1,"Participants marked up their inflation projections, as they assessed that supply constraints in product and labor markets were larger and likely to be longer lasting than previously anticipated.",1
2,The effects of reduced monetary and fiscal policy stimulus were expected to be counterbalanced by continued low long-term interest rates and an abatement of energy-related headwinds.,0
2,"That's particularly important, because the lags in the effect of policy on economic activity and prices mean that policy decisions are necessarily based on a view of the likely path for the economy over several years, relative to the Federal Reserve's legislated objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.",2

2,"With regard to our price-stability mandate,",2
1,"In the near term, 12-month measures of PCE inflation are expected to move above 2 percent as the very low readings from early in the pandemic fall out of the calculation and past increases in oil prices pass through to consumer energy prices.",1
1,"Without the oil shock, policymakers beginning from a period of low interest rates would try to keep the economy on an even growth path as they gradually raised nominal interest rates.",2
2,"A few participants also noted that uncertainty about the extent of resource slack in the economy was considerable and that it was quite possible that the economy could soon be operating close to potential, particularly if labor force participation rates did not turn up much while employment continued to register gains.",1

1,"In this regard the risks of rising inflation could not be dismissed, and",1
2,Productivity is a cyclical variable that typically falls in recessions.,2
1,"As a result, recent high inflation readings are transitory and not broad based.",0
1,"With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.",1
2,"Conversely, perhaps the transitory factors boosting productivity will recede more sharply than most observers anticipate, and the output gap will close more rapidly.",1
0,"To be sure, the prices of assets and the level of debt seem to reflect expectations of a benign economic environment--one in which policy will tighten only gradually, the economy will continue to strengthen and inflation will remain low, and the demand for houses and equities will remain solid.",0

2,"So you’re right, you’re seeing—I, I can’t remember the number, but it might be in the 3s—3, 3½ percent growth for next year.",1
1,"On this path, unemployment would decline modestly below current estimates of the natural rate and remain there for some time.",0
0,"In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.",0
1,And the equity market itself has been the subject of analysis as we attempt to assess the implications for financial and economic stability of the extraordinary rise in equity prices--a rise based apparently on continuing upward revisions in estimates of our corporations' already robust long-term earning prospects.,2
1,"Many observed, however, that a favorable outcome to the hostilities in the Middle East and lower oil prices in line with quotations in futures markets should generate a positive response in equity markets, boost consumer sentiment, and foster a rebound in consumer spending as the year progressed.",0
2,"These members indicated that the economic outlook remained positive and that they anticipated, under an unchanged policy stance, continued strong labor market conditions and solid growth in activity, with inflation gradually moving up to the Committee's 2 percent objective.",2
2,"Information on the price expectations of businesses--who are, after all, the price setters in the first instance--as well as information on nominal wage expectations is particularly scarce.",2
1,"For example, if financial market participants thought that the Federal Reserve were not dedicated to maintaining long-run price stability, they would be less willing to hold dollar-denominated assets and the resulting decline in the exchange value of the dollar would tend to add to inflationary pressures.",1

2,"With inflation low and resource use slack, the Committee saw no need for tightening policy in the near future.",0
0,"So, if we maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy for a very long time from here and the economy performs as we expect—namely, it’s strong and the risks that are out there don’t materialize—my concern will be that we will have much more tightening in labor markets than you see in these projections.",1

1,"Also, the Committee will pay close attention to measures of inflation expectations to ensure that those expectations remain well anchored.",2
0,"Despite the substantial monetary easing that had been implemented already and the fiscal stimulus, including federal tax rebates, that was in train, the forecast anticipated that sluggish hiring and the decline in household wealth would restrain the growth of both consumer spending and housing demand.",0
2,"Labor force participation isn't growing as much as one would expect with the hot job market, but apparently it's growing enough to keep the job creation machine humming.",2
2,"The technical measures we are undertaking do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy, which we continue to implement by adjusting the target range for the federal funds rate.",2

2,"One of the things we’ve learned from our financial crisis and from a series of financial crises in history and around the globe is that, very commonly, when the economy takes a hit and falls into a recession, that productivity doesn’t pick up to pre-recession levels and that there looks like there is a permanent hit to the path of potential output for the economy, which is called “hysteresis.” And I raised the question as to whether or not this might operate in the opposite direction as well.",2

0,"Moreover, when some measures of inflation were close to 1 percent in 2003, the Federal Open Market Committee's official statements specifically noted that any further substantial decline in inflation would be unwelcome, mainly because of the risk that a falling price level (which has not occurred since the Great Depression) could cause a significant disruption to economic activity and employment.",0

1,Several participants reported that business contacts had expressed growing concerns about the increase in their input costs and that there were signs that an increasing number of firms were seeking to pass on these higher costs to their customers in the form of higher prices.,1

Clarida At the 2021 Institute of International Finance Annual Membership Meeting: Sustainable Economic Growth and Financial Stability in a Diverging, Decarbonizing, Digitizing, Indebted World, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share It is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the 2021 Institute of International Finance Annual Membership Meeting.1 I regret that we are not meeting in person, but I look forward, as always, to a conversation with my good friend and one-time colleague Tim Adams.",2

0,still being clear about the Committee's intention to provide the monetary accommodation needed to support a return to maximum employment and stable prices.,0
0,"The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.",0
0,"Some also argue that resistance to nominal wage cuts will impart an upward bias to real wages as price stability approaches or outright deflation occurs, leaving the economy with a potentially higher level of unemployment in equilibrium.",0
0,"Partly because of high demand for Treasury securities, the overnight repo rate for Treasury general collateral was near zero for much of the period, and failures to deliver Treasury securities reached record highs.",2
0,"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.",2
2,"Nowhere, however, is the challenge to monetary policymakers greater than in emerging economies around the world.",2
0,"Housing starts and the demand for new homes had declined further, house prices in many parts of the country were falling faster than they had towards the end of 2007, and inventories of unsold homes remained quite elevated.",0
2,An extreme version of this view is that bubbles probably do not exist--that rational market processes always price assets at their fundamental value.,2
2,"With regards to inflation, the median inflation projection of FOMC participants is 2.4 percent this year and declines to 2 percent next year before moving back up to 2.1 percent in 2023.",2
2,"You can get to 20, if you wanted to, easily, but labor force participation, the unemployment rate, different age groups of—you know, prime-age labor force participation, in particular, gets a lot of focus, the JOLTS data get a lot of focus.",2
1,"” The vote encompassed approval of the text below for inclusion in the statement to be released at 2:15 p. m. : “In these circumstances, the Committee’s predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.",1
0,"And, of course, despite the improvements seen in the May jobs report, the unemployment rate, at 13.3 percent, remains historically high.",0
1,The latter could well be augmented by sharply rising medical costs and by attempts to protect the purchasing power of wages from the erosion caused by the rise in energy prices.,2
2,"This paper develops and estimates a habit persistence consumption asset pricing model in which the sign of the equilibrium covariance between equity and bond returns depends on the reduced-form correlation between inflation and the output gap, the correlation between the federal funds rate and the output gap, as well as the equilibrium persistence of inflation.",2
1,"In their assessment of factors leading to this decision, the members focused on the further evidence that moderating demand and accelerating productivity were closing the gap between the growth of aggregate demand and potential supply, even before earlier Committee tightening actions had exerted their full restraining effects.",1
0,"By reducing our scope to support the economy by cutting interest rates, the lower bound increases downward risks to employment and inflation.22 To counter these risks, we are prepared to use our full range of tools to support the economy.",0
0,"In contrast, some other participants judged that the economy had not yet reached maximum employment.",0
1,Treasury yields rose sharply on its release as market participants traced out the report's presumed implications for monetary policy.,1
1,"Inflation rose further in most foreign economies, reflecting a reversal of price declines seen in the spring of 2020, higher energy and commodity prices, and supply bottlenecks.",2
2,An easing of supply constraints was expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation.,0
2,"In each case, my own preferred approach is to take the other variable into account in performing our main job of dealing with inflation and unemployment",2
1,"The large current account deficit was seen as a factor pointing to potential depreciation of the dollar over time, with adverse repercussions on domestic inflation albeit favorable effects on exports.",0
1,"With today's action, the real federal funds rate--measured as the difference between the nominal funds rate and a moving average of core PCE inflation--would move slightly into positive territory.",1
2,"While there were no current indications that inflation might be accelerating and no policy move was called for at this time, the members saw a need for continuing vigilance.",2
2,"But even for many other workers, a rapidly evolving work environment in which the skill demands of their jobs are changing can lead to very real anxiety and insecurity about losing their jobs.",2
2,"On balance, most participants still expected inflation to moderate later this year and in 2009.",0
1,"The current global environment highlights the importance of having strong analytic and empirical foundations to understand financial stability considerations for monetary policy, and the research presented today will help strengthen those foundations.1 The global environment of high inflation and rising interest rates highlights the importance of paying attention to financial stability considerations for monetary policy.",2
0,"In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.",0
2,"Moreover, measures of labor compensation showed only moderate gains while relatively wide profit margins could allow firms to absorb somewhat larger increases in labor and other costs without boosting prices.",0
0,"Nonetheless, participants generally saw the unemployment rate as still elevated and were not yet confident that the recent progress toward the Committee's employment objective would be sustained.",0
0,"In our new framework, we acknowledge that policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC's estimates of ""shortfalls [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level""â€”not ""deviations.",0
0,"With regard to the consensus in favor of moving from an assessment of risks weighted toward rising inflation to one that was weighted toward economic weakness, with no intermediate issuance of a balanced risks assessment, some members observed that such a change was likely to be viewed as a relatively rapid shift by some observers.",0

1,"Measures of longer-term inflation expectations edged up in early January, but remained lower than they had been in all but the last few weeks of 2008.",2
2,"Computing power may not be falling in price quite so rapidly now as in the late 1990s, but a dollar nevertheless buys a great deal more computational capacity today than it did even five years ago.",2
0,The October SLOOS suggested that the recent slowdown in mortgage originations for home purchases was partly attributable to weaker demand.,2
2,"After deteriorating further early in the period, foreign equity prices bounced back and credit spreads on emerging market bonds narrowed, in both cases returning to December levels in most countries.",2
1,Many participants commented that measures of short-term inflation expectations were elevated or that far-forward measures of inflation compensation were near the upper edge of their historical range.,1
2,"But even this relation--between the unemployment rate and the concept of economic slack--is not necessarily constant, and thus a given unemployment rate may not indicate the same level of slack at two separate times.",2
2,"But I have showed that past experience actually indicates that a reduction in vacancies can take place without a big loss of employment, and this is the kind of soft landing anticipated by FOMC participants.",0
0,"Total nonfarm payroll employment was reported to have decreased in September, consistent with a substantial increase in the number of people who reported themselves as being absent from work due to bad weather and with payroll declines in the hurricane-affected states of Texas and Florida.",0
0,"We, frankly, didn’t even get inflation back up to target—without seeing wages getting out of touch with—with where they should be, so that’s the—that’s the biggest thing we can do.",0
0,"Participants also observed that crude oil prices fell over the intermeeting period and other commodity prices also moderated, developments that were likely to damp headline inflation at the consumer level going forward.",0
2,This linkage establishes one important connection between the FOMC's target funds rate and interest rates more broadly.,2
0,"Nonetheless, with the unemployment rate anticipated to increase somewhat during the remainder of 2009 and to decline only gradually in 2010, the staff still expected core PCE inflation to slow substantially over the forecast period; the very low readings on hourly compensation lately suggested that such a process might already be in train.",0
0,"Low readings on overall and core consumer price inflation in recent months, as well as the weakened economic outlook, kept near-term inflation expectations reported in surveys well below their high levels in mid-2008.",0
2,"The specific price-stability target of an inflation rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, was announced as part of the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy following the January 2012 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.",2
0,"We’re not seeing evidence in labor markets of very substantial upward pressures on labor that could signify extreme shortages of labor that could propel inflation higher in a very rapid way, and inflation is still operating below our objective.",0
2,"So the FOMC will always, in some sense, trump the projections of forward interest rates, but clearly, because the participants and the people around the table are the same, the projections should give significant information about where the FOMC is likely to go.",2
0,"A few participants expressed less confidence in this outlook for inflation and commented that inflation had averaged less than 2 percent over the past several years even as resource utilization had increased, or pointed to downward pressures from global or technology-related factors that could continue to suppress inflation.",0
0,Accelerating productivity poses a significant complication for economic forecasting.,2
0,This secular decline in term premiums since 1990 appears to be correlated with the decline in long-run inflation uncertainty and in short-term interest rate uncertainty.,2
1,"The severity of the 1981-82 recession, the worst of the postwar period, clearly illustrates the danger of letting inflation get out of control.",1
1,wholesale prices edged up in March relative to their level of a year earlier and posted the first increase on a twelve-month basis since July 2000.,1
1,"During the past several years, workers across the wage distribution--not just at the upper end--have seen noticeable increases in the inflation-adjusted value of their wages.",2
1,"Demand-pull inflation pressures from emerging-market economies abroad appeared to be continuing, and anecdotal reports from business contacts suggested greater willingness domestically to pass rising costs through to prices.",1
2,"To be sure, financial market signals are noisy, and day-to-day movements in asset prices are unlikely to tell us much about the cyclical or structural position of the economy, let alone r* and expected inflation.",2
2,"In the simplest version of his model, Bill assumed that the central bank could choose to specify its monetary policy actions in terms of a particular level of a monetary aggregate or a particular value of a short-term nominal interest rate.",2
0,"This increase was slower than a year earlier, as core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices) moved down to 1.",0
2,"There’s a lot more demand for risk sharing, for liquidity services, and so on.",2
2,"Monetary Policy in a World without Treasuries Today, monetary policy decisions are implemented through a mix of outright purchases and sales of assets held in the Fed's portfolio, temporary operations through repurchase agreements, and discount window loans.2 It seems to me that the same three operations, though perhaps in different proportions, could be used in the absence of Treasury securities.",2
1,"Through our business contacts, we continue to hear stories about bottlenecks at almost every stage of production and distributionâ€”for example, plants that shut down because of a shortage of one or more crucial inputs; a poor cotton crop in the United States due to weather, which is driving up prices; and clogged ports and trucker shortages.",2
0,"Prominent among these risks were a possible intensification of strains in the euro zone, with potential spillovers to U. S. financial markets and institutions and thus to the broader U. S. economy; a larger-than-expected U. S. fiscal tightening; and the possibility of a further slowdown in global economic growth.",0
2,"Against this background, the members agreed on the need to continue to monitor the economy with care for signs either of a potential upturn in inflation or greater softness in the expansion than they were currently forecasting and to be prepared to respond promptly in either direction.",2
2,The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.,2
0,"Most projected somewhat slower growth through next year, and a smaller reduction in unemployment, than they had projected in April.",0
0,"As technical change increases demand for skilled relative to unskilled labor, the unskilled workers must acquire new skills, find new jobs at lower relative wages, or become unemployed.",2
1,"Without a reduction of aggregate demand growth, inflation would rise.",1
2,"In coming months, as those earlier declines drop out of the calculation, inflation should move up closer to 2 percent and stabilize around that level over the medium term.",2
2,"A particular phenomenon that touches on all these issues is the movement of asset prices, especially the prices of equities and residential real estate.",2
2,"In any case, however, the assessment of the adverse effects of the increase in longer-term rates on financial conditions and ultimately on economic activity would depend importantly upon the extent to which rates stabilized at current levels or instead continued to rise.",2
0,"For example, the unemployment rate has risen by 0.3 percentage points since March, and new claims for unemployment insurance have moved somewhat higher.",0
2,"There are a variety of versions of this basic approach, depending on measures of utilization and inflation rates and depending on whether the adjustment is made in response to past and current movements in utilization and inflation rates or in response to forecasts of these variables.",2
2,Germany and Japan--whose economies have been growing slowly despite very low interest rates--have not.,2
2,Our tools work on demand.,2
2,"With regard to our price-stability mandate,",2
1,The Federal Reserve is fully committed to both sides of its mandate—to price stability as well as to maximum employment—and it has both the tools and the will to act at the appropriate time to avoid any emerging threat to price stability.,2
2,This information helps Committee members deduce how their own actions and statements are likely to affect asset prices and yields.,2
1,"The recent decline in the dollar was another factor that could add to inflation pressures,",1
0,"These participants stated that, in such circumstances, a major challenge facing policymakers—especially in the presence of the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate—was to maintain a policy stance sufficiently accommodative to keep average inflation at 2 percent and thereby bolster the credibility of the Committee's new policy framework, facilitating the achievement of both maximum employment and price stability.",0
2,"Employment continued to expand unevenly,",2
2,Some occasions call for significant swings in currency or reserves because of seasonal demands for cash and loans.,2
0,"Moreover, most members saw substantial downside risks to the economic outlook and judged that a rate reduction at this meeting would provide valuable additional insurance against an unexpectedly severe weakening in economic activity.",0
0,"An environment involving such interest rates could have adverse repercussions on the functioning of some sectors of the money market, but the members agreed that the potential extent of such disruptions would not be sufficient to prevent the Committee from taking advantage of the full scope of conventional easing of the federal funds rate, should that become necessary.",0
2,"In the end, they concurred that the statement should note that economic growth had rebounded in the current quarter but that it appeared likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace in coming quarters.",2
2,"Whether one looks at trailing or forward price-to-earnings ratios, equity risk premiums, or option prices, there is little basis for arguing that markets show excessive optimism about future returns.",2
1,Committee Policy Action Committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity was expanding at a moderate pace.,2
1,This monetary expansion could generate domestic inflation unless it is sterilized with other open market sales of securities--and the mere scale of present and expected future debt stocks may make continued sterilization impossible.,1
2,That should drive productivity.,2
2,"As a policymaker, I can assure you that any model of inflation that did not take account of these effects, and how they might or might not affect ongoing rates of inflation, would have been of little practical use to the FOMC over the past few years.",2
1,Another factor that has contributed to the swing toward current-account surplus among the non-industrialized nations in the past few years is the sharp rise in oil prices.,2
0,"Since June, however, inflation fears have receded, and some financial-market participants have become less optimistic about the economy's near-term growth prospects.",0
1,"Participants marked up their inflation projections, as they assessed that supply constraints in product and labor markets were larger and likely to be longer lasting than previously anticipated.",1
2,"Referring to monetary policy developments in the 1980s, Greenspan writes: In recognition of the lag in monetary policy's impact on economic activity, a preemptive response to the potential for building inflationary pressures was made an even more important feature of policy.",1
0,"But many other commodity prices have fallen further, and the reason I would give for that is that the emerging markets—China, the rest of Asia, and some other parts of the world—plus Europe, of course, are softer, and so global commodity demand is weaker.",0
2,"Moreover, the expected strength in aggregate demand would curb the extent of disinflation over time.",1
0,"That should gradually return the economy to full utilization of its resources, while inflation remains subdued.",2
2,"as a result, headline PCE price inflation was expected to substantially exceed core PCE price inflation in 2008.",2
2,"This modal projection for the path of the unemployment rate is, according to the Atlanta Fed jobs calculator, consistent with a rebound in labor force participation to its estimated demographic trend and is also consistent with cumulative employment gains this year and next that, by the end of 2022, eliminate the 7 million ""employment gap"" relative to the previous cycle peak I mentioned earlier.5 As is the case for GDP growth and the unemployment rate, my projections for headline and core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation are also similar to the paths of the SEP median of modal projections for these variables.",2
2,Setting the horizon on the interest rate caps to reinforce forward guidance on the policy rate would augment the credibility of the yield curve caps and thereby diminish concerns about an open-ended balance sheet commitment.,2
2,"the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâ€”and the challengeâ€”of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate.",2
2,"In the current decade, however, the standard deviation of inflation has been relatively stable in Brazil, at around 5 percent, and it has been declining in Mexico, where it is now around 2 percent.",2
0,Both of these views would suggest a lower level of potential output and thus reduced scope for combating unemployment with additional monetary policy stimulus.,1
0,"The Committee directs the Desk to purchase agency debt, agency MBS, and longer-term Treasury securities during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity.",0
2,"But in terms of just targeting growth, you know, I think—I actually think our dual mandate works very well, which is maximum employment and stable prices.",2
2,"Headline stock price indexes in the AFEs generally ended the period higher, whereas bank stocks in Europe declined.",2
1,The risk of higher inflation in this environment has two dimensions.,2
0,And we were actually quite concerned that growth was not sufficient to continue to bring the unemployment rate down.,0
2,also by views about how fiscal policy might adjust to monetary policy.,2
2,"As stock prices soared in the 1990s, the share of equity holdings in household portfolios surpassed the share of owner-occupied housing.",2
0,"In particular, we are closely monitoring the emergence of the coronavirus, which is likely to have a noticeable impact on Chinese growth, at least in the first quarter of this year.",2
0,"Remarkably, 30-year Treasury yields were only slightly lower than 10-year yields throughout the episode, implying that the markets had no confidence that inflation would ever return to 1950s or 1960s levels.",2
2,"Wage growth is not—there are many factors that affect it—it’s not definitive in any sense in determining our policy,",2
0,"In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U. S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employment and price-stability goals.",0
0,"Though widely anticipated even before the actions of October, the recession and retrenchment in employment that followed those actions resulted in pressures on the Federal Reserve to reverse course.",0
0,"Indeed, the members did not rule out the emergence of appreciably lower inflation.",0
2,"To keep the experiments as clean as possible, I assume that the economy begins at full employment and with both headline and core inflation at desired levels.",2
2,Industrial production picked up in response to the advance in final demand and a slowdown in the runoff of excess inventory stocks.,2
1,"Of course, if excessive inflationary pressures were to build or inflation expectations were to ratchet above levels consistent with our goal, we would not hesitate to act.",1
2,"The run-up in mortgage rates since the latter part of June was expected to curb housing demand to a limited extent in coming months,",2
2,"The dual mandate seems proper and fitting, given that economic costs are incurred both by having inflation stray from its long-run goal and by having output deviate from the economy's potential to produce",2
2,"In their review of the outlook for prices, members noted that incoming data over the intermeeting period had shown a slowing in core inflation from the high levels posted earlier in the year, consistent with the Committee's view that a portion of the earlier increase had reflected transitory factors.",0
2,The FOMC's primary monetary policy tool is its target range for the federal funds rate.,2
0,"Although participants considered it unlikely that the economy would reenter a recession, many expressed concern that output growth, and the associated progress in reducing the level of unemployment, could be slow for some time.",0
2,"It is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today.1 I look forward to our conversation, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework.",2
1,"Nevertheless, the path of inflation is the biggest risk to my outlook.",2
0,"We also said we wouldn’t raise rates just in response to very low unemployment, in the absence of inflation.",0
2,"Williamson cited Hayek's 1945 paper, along with Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations from the eighteenth century, as forming the core of a ""venerated tradition in economics"" of studying the notion of ""spontaneous order"" arising from a freely operating market system.9 How does Hayek's case for the price system fit in alongside the other work that Williamson mentioned?",2
1,"The broad index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar rose nearly 3 percent over the intermeeting period amid the rise in U. S. interest rates, market expectations that U. S. tax reform was becoming more likely, and foreign central bank actions and communications.",1
2,Experienced loan officers who are well acquainted with their markets can channel funds into the loans that are most likely to create wealth and growth in the local economy.,2

2,"Discussion of Communications Regarding Economic Projections As a follow-up to the FOMC's discussion in October about providing more information on the Committee's collective judgment regarding the economic outlook and appropriate monetary policy, the staff presented several options for enhancing the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).",2
2,The Federal Reserve and ECB Framework Reviews The monetary policy framework reviews conducted by the Federal Reserve and the ECB provide another example of monetary policy correlation.,2
2,"First, I will discuss the available empirical evidence from the United States on the effect of changes in asset prices on household consumption and business investment.",2
2,Same thing with economic activity.,2
0,The recent strains in financial markets posed additional downside risks to economic growth.,0
1,Most participants continued to think that the cyclical pressures associated with a tightening labor market were likely to show through to higher inflation over the medium term.,1
1,"However, the historical record suggests that permanently lowering inflation expectations may require keeping monetary policy tight for a substantial period, resulting in considerable output and employment losses for a time.",1
0,"So we want to see that healthy process unfold as we decide what the true state of the economy is, and we think it will evolve in a way that will mean lower inflation.",0
0,Domestic respondents to the April SLOOS generally reported tightening their lending standards and experiencing weaker loan demand across all major CRE loan categories during the first quarter.,1
2,"For the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at the Bank of England, they find heterogeneous views among voters, but no systematic differences based on whether the MPC member is an insider--that is part of the hierarchy at the Bank--or an outsider appointed for a short term just to the MPC; whether the person comes from an academic background; or whether that person has worked at the Treasury.",2
0,"In fact, it’s already—it’s already understood, I think, that—that there’s more—even though we’re at 3½ percent unemployment, there’s actually more slack out there, in a sense.",0
0,"The risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting the staff's assessment that monetary policy appeared to be better positioned to offset large positive shocks than substantial adverse ones.",0
0,"Indeed, stock prices did not collapse in 1929 but only began to plummet when the depth of the general economic decline became apparent.",2
2,The current range readily encompassed the growth rate seen likely to be associated with the members' forecasts for economic activity and prices.,2
0,Members expected to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until those outcomes were achieved.,0
0,"U.S. monetary policy responded to these global ""headwinds,"" helping stave off actual contractions of U.S. activity.",0
1,"In light of the robust expansion of capital spending thus far this year, the outlook for business investment spending was revised up appreciably, as more of the strength over the latter part of 2004 was attributed to underlying demand and less to the effects of the partial-expensing tax provision.",1
2,They noted that economic activity and employment had continued to recover,2
2,Survey and market measures of long-term inflation expectations did not suggest that the earlier higher inflation readings were going to persist.,0
2,"Eventually, financial markets may develop the instruments and associated analytical techniques for unearthing these implicit changes in the price level with some precision.",2
2,"However, in light of the projected persistence of slack in labor and product markets and the anticipated stability in long-term inflation expectations, the increase in inflation was expected to be mostly transitory if oil and other commodity prices did not rise significantly further.",0
1,"It was noted, however, that increases in compensation that exceeded productivity gains might be absorbed to some extent by a narrowing of firms’ high profit margins.",2
2,"One might even argue that if a central bank ever converged on a single monetary rule, there would be no need for a monetary policy committee.",2
2,"Our test for this step was making ""substantial further progress"" toward our employment and inflation goals.",2
2,"Once this process is completed, however, we might expect consumer price inflation to move into better alignment with long-run expectations and thus settle in around 2 percent.",2
2,"The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.",2
2,Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.,2
2,"multifactor productivity growth fell to a pace of 0.4 percent, the slowest pace of any of the periods shown on the table.",0
0,"Nevertheless, the staff continued to forecast that real GDP growth would pick up only gradually in 2012 and 2013, supported by accommodative monetary policy, easing credit conditions, and improvements in consumer and business sentiment.",0

2,This evaluation assumed continued sluggish growth in final demand during the period immediately ahead.,0
2,"First, the expansion of trade may cause domestic inflation to depend to a greater extent on the prices of imported goods--not only because imported goods enter the consumer basket or (in the case of imported intermediate goods) affect the costs of domestic production, but because competition with imports affects the pricing power of domestic producers.",2
1,"No matter the near-term path of reducing accommodation, the FOMC must respond decisively to the data so as to maintain our credibility that we will bring down inflation.",1
0,"The risks to the forecast for real GDP growth and inflation were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting recent financial developments and concerns about the foreign economic outlook, as well as the staff's assessment that neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy appeared well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks.",0
1,"Household spending was projected to grow at a fairly solid rate, supported by higher employment and somewhat lower energy prices but damped somewhat by lessened stimulus from gains in wealth and the need for households to rebuild savings.",2
2,Risk sentiment abroad fluctuated over the intermeeting period as market participants weighed increasing coronavirus cases in a number of countries against improving economic data releases and ongoing fiscal and monetary policy support.,2
2,"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.",2

2,"A more-timely data source, average hourly earnings, decelerated slightly to a 4.4 percent annual rate over the third quarter, down from 4.6 percent annual growth in the second quarter.",0
1,"Against this backdrop, today the Federal Open Market Committee raised its policy interest rate by ¾ percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in that rate will be appropriate.",1

0,The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.,0
2,"The absence of further large gains in stock prices, should recent trends persist, would remove this stimulus and probably induce some moderation in the growth of consumer spending.",2
1,"And, by the end of this year, I support having the policy rate at a level above neutral so that it is reducing demand for products and labor, bringing it more in line with supply and thus helping rein in inflation.",1

1,"Because his econometric analysis of the available data indicated that money demand was more stable than aggregate demand, Bill formulated a simple rule that adjusted the money growth rate in response to the observed unemployment rate.",2
0,"To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,"" andâ€”in the same sentenceâ€”that therefore ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.""",0

1,"One participant suggested that excess liquidity might be leading to speculation in commodity markets, possibly putting upward pressure on prices.",1
0,"The staff continued to project that the accommodative stance of monetary policy, together with a further attenuation of financial stress, the waning of adverse effects of earlier declines in wealth, and improving household and business confidence, would support a moderate recovery in economic activity and a gradual decline in the unemployment rate over the next two years.",0

Clarida At the ""Macroeconomic Policy and Global Economic Recovery"" 2021 Asia Economic Policy Conference, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Center for Pacific Basin Studies, San Francisco, California (via webcast) Share Watch Live In my remarks today, I would like to offer some perspectives on global monetary policy correlation and what it canâ€”and cannotâ€”reveal about the prevalence and value of global monetary policy coordination or, in the limit, binding global monetary cooperation.1 In both the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the Global Pandemic Collapse (GPC), major central banks around the world responded by cutting policy rates to, and then keeping them at, their effective lower bounds (ELBs); by increasing their balance sheets through ambitious and expansive large-scale asset purchase and lending programs; and by offering forward guidanceâ€”both Delphic and Odysseanâ€”on the stance of their future monetary policies.2 As these examples make clear, we certainly do observe that national monetary policies are often correlated, and such examples are not confined to recent experience.",0
0,"The changes—the financial market changes that you described, particularly the increase in stock prices, the increase in longer-term rates, and the strengthening of the dollar, suggest that many market participants anticipate expansionary fiscal policies that would raise interest rates somewhat in the United States relative to abroad and would cause a strengthening in the dollar.",1
1,"Moreover, substantial gains in productivity were muting the effects of rising labor compensation on unit costs, and vigorous competition in numerous markets was continuing to make it very difficult or impossible for business firms to raise their prices to cover rising costs or enhance profit margins.",0

0,"While the underlying demand for residential housing continued to be robust and government outlays evidently were rising, the expansion of consumer spending seemed to have slowed, and outlays for capital spending were still very sluggish in an environment of business uncertainty and pessimism.",2
1,"But strong demand and a very tight labor market have also contributed to inflation pressures, and the FOMC can help alleviate those pressures by removing the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation that is no longer needed.",1
2,The guidance indicates an expectation that it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range of the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.,0
2,Several members reiterated that business spending was the critical factor that would govern to a substantial degree the timing and extent of the acceleration in overall economic activity.,2
2,Implications for Monetary Policy The period from 1950 through the early 1980s provides two important lessons for managing the risks and uncertainties we face today.,2
2,Equity prices in most foreign countries were up moderately since the January FOMC meeting.,2

2,"Although in a number of sectors of the economy the imbalances between demand and supplyâ€”including labor supplyâ€”are substantial, I do continue to judge that these imbalances are likely to dissipate over time as the labor market and global supply chains eventually adjust and, importantly, do so without putting persistent upward pressure on price inflation, wage gains adjusted for productivity, and the 2 percent longer-run inflation objective.",0
2,A key factor in this assessment continued to be their outlook for rapid further gains in structural productivity that would help to hold down increases in unit labor costs.,2
2,But I have seen little direct evidence on the extent to which globalization may have boosted aggregate productivity growth in the United States in recent years.,2
